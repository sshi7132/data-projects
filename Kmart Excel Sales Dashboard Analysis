Kmart Sales Analysis Dashboard
This project is a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard for Kmart, developed to provide actionable insights from transactional data. The primary objective was to transform raw, unclean sales data into a dynamic and interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and make informed business decisions.

Key Features & Analysis
Data Cleaning and Transformation:
The process began with meticulous data cleaning, addressing inconsistencies in formats (e.g., date formats like '03rdDec2023') and handling missing values, such as suburbs and postcodes. This preparatory step was crucial to ensure data integrity and the accuracy of all subsequent analyses.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
The dashboard visualizes critical KPIs to provide a high-level overview of sales performance:

Total Sales: The total sales across all channels amounted to over $3.18 million.

Sales Channel Contribution: A significant finding is the dominance of Kmart Stores, which account for approximately $2.53 million (79%) of total sales, while Kmart Online contributed about $658,000 (21%).

Average Sales per Transaction: The average sales per transaction is approximately $707, indicating a strong average basket size.

Insights and Key Takeaways:

Geographic Performance: The analysis revealed that New South Wales is the top-performing state, generating over $1.16 million in sales. The dashboard includes a map visualization to highlight sales distribution across different states.

Top-Performing Categories: The dashboard identifies the most profitable product categories. The top three are:

Home & Living: Over $1.18 million

Toys & Outdoor Play: Over $549,000

Footwear: Over $381,000

Monthly Sales Trends: A monthly trend analysis shows that sales peak in December and January, likely due to holiday shopping. This insight can help in planning inventory and staffing for peak seasons.

Top-Performing Managers and Suburbs: The dashboard provides a breakdown of sales by manager and suburb, identifying Rachael Long as the top-performing manager with sales of over $309,000, and Frankston as the top-performing suburb with over $105,000 in sales. This information is valuable for performance evaluation and targeted marketing strategies.

Buyer Performance: The dashboard also tracks sales by buyer, revealing that Bruce Curran and Elizabeth Gentry are the top performers. This can inform future buying decisions and vendor relationships.

Objective of the Project
The project's objective was to demonstrate proficiency in the entire data analysis lifecycle, from data cleaning and transformation to creating insightful visualizations. By presenting these key insights, the dashboard serves as a powerful tool for Kmart's management to understand sales dynamics, identify areas for growth, and optimize business strategies.
